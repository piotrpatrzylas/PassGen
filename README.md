# ![logo](pg.ico) PassGen

A tool used to generate and menage passwords. It allows to generate up to 10 passwords, encrypt them and saved to a password-protected *.pgen file. Using the same program *.pgen file can be opened and decrypted using provided password.

## Motivation

The aim of this project was to help menage passwords and keep them in the ecrypted form for safety reasons. Many users have to change passwords on a regular basis (like every 3 months). It is way much easier to create a list of passwords, divide them in 1-10 categories and then use this tool to generate/store passwords for such a list.
